    <h2>Dragon Project Revision And Reflection</h2>
    <p>I showed project to a family friend they said that they were impressed with what I was able to come up with on my
      initial draft. One thing that was pointed out to me was they felt the color was a little to dark. I took this into
      consideration and lightened the fonts on my pages to make everything easier to read.</p>
    <p>Working on this project has been a mix of a the things that I have learned over this semester. The skills that I
      have learned in HTML and CSS have served me well in this website design. I have learned to structure my content in
      a way that is meaningful and useful. I feel that I have done well in all the assignments that have been given to
      me. I feel like I would make the same overall decisions given the things I know now. I plan to incorperate the
      feedback given to me by both my instructor and peers and create a greater version 2.</p>
    <h2>Thoghts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is the concept of working from the most basic layer and building up to the more complex
      version later. Instead of the old method of building for the most complex and then taking care of the older
      browser versions later. You build from the content up and add css and javascript to make it more interesting. This
      is a better approach because it does not leave out a large ammount of your user base. It is important because it
      allows you to build the most accessible websites that can be enjoyed by the most people. <a
