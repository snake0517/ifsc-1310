    <h2>Dragon Project Revision And Reflection</h2>
    <p>I showed project to a family friend they said that they were impressed with what I was able to come up with on my
      initial draft. One thing that was pointed out to me was they felt the color was a little to dark. I took this into
      consideration and lightened the fonts on my pages to make everything easier to read. I think that I am going to
      switch out the background color with a image in my version 2.</p>
    <p>Working on this project has been a mix of a the things that I have learned over this semester. The skills that I
      have learned in HTML and CSS have served me well in this website design. I have learned to structure my content in
      a way that is meaningful and useful. I feel that I have done well in all the assignments that have been given to
      me. I feel like I would make the same overall decisions given the things I know now. I plan to incorperate the
      feedback given to me by both my instructor and peers and create a greater version 2</p>
